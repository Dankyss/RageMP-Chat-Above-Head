# RageMP Chat Above Head
 
Made for RAGEMP only tested on 1.1

[rage.mp post](https://rage.mp/files/file/366-js-chat-messages-above-head-and-typing-indicator/)

I made this by using [heyMad](https://rage.mp/profile/30788-heymad/)'s guide for online IDS (originally made by [hartority](https://rage.mp/profile/46-hartority/)) as a base for the above head text and used some getVariable and setVariable and boom here we are

You can change the colour of the (( Typing )) and the actual text in the clientside file.

You can also change how long the message stays above the head in the serverside js file, the default time is 5 seconds.

Huge thanks to [heyMad](https://rage.mp/profile/30788-heymad/) and [hartority](https://rage.mp/profile/46-hartority/) for making the guides without them this would not be possible :) 

 
This resource removes the default rage nametags, I recommend you replace them with [these ones](https://rage.mp/forums/topic/2568-v035-implementing-custom-nametags/)
